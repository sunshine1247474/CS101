# CS101 Basic level Python Terminal Game
1st Python Project for Code Academy
Battleships Python Game

Battle of ships against artificial intelligence:
The player plays against the computer and tries to beat the binary machine. This machine is more bright and faster than humans are. 

Good that my game doesn't have a timer :)
The game includes coordinates and a fleet of ships of different sizes that both sides have and are required to compete with.

The architecture code is somewhat complex and includes a large majority of functions. Each function has a necessary role in the dynamics of the game. Notable among them, check_ok() strictly verifies the validity of ship positions, get_ship() facilitates player ship placement and create_ships() authorizes players to assemble their armada. On the opponent front, create_boats() generates a crafty AI fleet, while get_shot_comp() invents computer-generated shots guided by tactical logic.

The vital function that makes it simple for the user to play against the computer is show_board(). The virtual battlefield is Backended by binary-level code that just the computer can understand. Delivers the computer unfair advantages, where is the user on the upper field (the visual board existing in the terminal) can have equal benefits.

The game is challenging, including carefully detailing hits, misses, and ships on both fronts. As the game progresses, the tools are strategically focused, submerged, and the computer's tactics evolve, culminating in an electrifying and immersive experience.

Code Battleships in Python are an excellent challenge for beginner programmers. There are many ways to program it. Any little program a person creates helps him understand and create code faster to advance his skills.
