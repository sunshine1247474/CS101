# CS101 Basic level Python Terminal Game
1st Python-Project for Code Academy
Battleships Python Game

Battle of ships against artificial intelligence:
The player plays against the computer with the aim of trying to beat a binary machine that also has a mind and even if it is faster, it's good that my game doesn't have a timer. The game includes coordinates and a fleet of ships of different sizes that must be eliminated from the opponent.

An introduction that shares the background information ("why"):
I haven't created games in my life mainly not through programming. I noticed that both teaching someone to program this game and also to build it in the github core is significant and a big step for someone who doesn't understand much about software.

Accompanying paragraph describing my Python code:
The architecture of the code is somewhat complex and includes a large majority of functions, each of which plays an important role in the dynamics of the game. Notable among them, check_ok() strictly verifies the validity of ship positions, get_ship() facilitates player ship placement, and create_ships() authorizes players to assemble their armada. On the opponent front, create_boats() generates a crafty AI fleet, while get_shot_comp() invents computer-generated shots guided by tactical logic.

The main function that makes it simple for the user to play against the computer is show_board() which serves as the virtual battlefield, carefully detailing hits, misses and ships on both fronts. As the game progresses, the tools are strategically focused, submerged, and the computer's tactics evolve, culminating in an electrifying and immersive experience.

conclusion:

The game Battleships Python is a challenging game for beginning metallers. There are many ways to program it like any other game or tool. The game allowed me to think simply about the design of code and small details and to get to know different libraries as tools.
